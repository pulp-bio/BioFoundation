ARES targets the PULP (Parallel Ultra-Low-Power Processing) platform ecosystem. The following projects are acknowledged as references and related work in this space:

ARES kernel comments reference "PULP-NN style" optimization patterns (e.g., SIMD unrolling, im2col strategies). ARES kernels are independent implementations; no PULP-NN source code is incorporated.

The ARES NE16 accelerator driver references pulp-nnx documentation for hardware register interface compatibility.

DORY is a related deployment framework for PULP platforms. ARES was developed independently with a different architecture (data-driven pipeline, arena memory, hierarchical streaming) but targets the same hardware ecosystem. And the ideas presented in DORY reflect a lot of what I value in good model deployment code (easy to read, easy to add new features). DORY is also the framework that allowed me to deploy most of my advanced models before using ARES (BrainFuseNet, ECG-TCNet etc.).

ARES uses Brevitas for quantization-aware training of source models. Brevitas is a runtime dependency, not distributed with ARES.
